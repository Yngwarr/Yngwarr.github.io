This post-mortem is long overdue, but as we approach Global Game Jam and the
next Ludum Dare, I think it would be useful to reflect on my latest game jam.
That was my 15th Ludum Dare in a row, a wild streak that I'd never think of
achieving.

This time we embarked on our journey with a team of four: [Syudzius][syu] took the
artlead role, [Owly][owly] did all the 3D modelling, [Shishandr][shish] made
epic animaitons and I glued all that together with code. We had the opportunity
to meet up locally and yeah, jamming from one room with friends makes the
experience much more pleasant and fun.

The theme was _Limited Space_ and we made the game about herding sheep called
_How many sheep can you fit?_

## What did we do?

## How did it end up?

### The good

- Working in a team was a smooth experience.
- We managed to squeeze in some progression.
- Everyone had something to do.
- I'm so proud of the ending sequence.

## The bad

- Controls turned out to be whack. Camera turned out to be even whacker.
- Progression turned out to be repetitive to the point of frustration.
