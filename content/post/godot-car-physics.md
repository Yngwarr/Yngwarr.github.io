title: "Handling car physics in Godot 4"
category: godot

The first time I've tried using a Godot's car physics was during the previous
Ludum Dare and I was surprised by how straightforward it is compared to Unity's.
The only hiccup I found was that the default values for many properties are super
weird and even work against what's written in docs. The purpose of this post is
to close this gap and to show you how to make car physics work.
