      <description>My 14th Ludum Dare in a row have finally finished and it was a wild experience! It was the first time I made a 3D game with Godot and also the very first time I used Godot 4, which turned out to be a bit unstable, but pretty usable.&#xA;As always, I teamed up with my wonderful artist, Syudzius, to take part in our 10th Ludum Dare together. The theme was Delivery and we made the game called Early Morning Tofu Delivery.</description>
