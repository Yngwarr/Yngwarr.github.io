Hi! My name is Igor.
Here's some stuff by me you can find in the World Wide Web:

* __I participate in [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/users/yngvarr/).__
  What started as a challenge quickly became a good tradition of mine.
  Twice a year I spend three days in a row to create a game from scratch
  with my friends. Usually I act as a team leader and a programmer. Every time
  we finish with a complete game and have a lot of fun.

* __I make games.__ Sometimes jam games grow beyond the initial scope. Also, I'm
  always open to test new gameplay ideas as they come. The full list of games
  I've made (solo or in team) lies on my [itch.io page](https://yngwarr.itch.io).
  Here are my favorite ones:
